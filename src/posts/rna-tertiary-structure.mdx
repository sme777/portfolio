title: 'On the Importance of RNA Tertiary Structures'
abstract: Is 98% of the transcibed RNA in humans junk? While this may be a foolish question now, just a few decades ago scientists across the world treated non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as useless, redundant cellular biproduct. Since then we have learned about the myriad of functions of ncRNAs, but we are still far from understanding what the majority of these RNAs do. In this article, I cover the history, advances, and the outlook for unveiling the functions and properties of these wonder molecules.
