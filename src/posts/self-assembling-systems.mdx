title: Self-Assembly - What We Can Learn from Biology
abstract: Proteins spotanesouly assemble into highly-complex shapes with a resolution of a millitonth that of a width of human hair, yet these are some of the most highly conserved and functional molecules that have ever existed. The best human-created technology with equivalent rsolution is about 1000x larger. What can we learn from these robust biological molecules and how can we utilize them for the invention of next-generation nanotechnology?
