{"pageProps":{"posts":[{"title":"On the Importance of RNA Tertiary Structures","abstract":"Is 98% of the transcibed RNA in humans junk? While this may be a foolish question now, just a few decades ago scientists across the world treated non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as useless, redundant cellular biproduct. Since then we have learned about the myriad of functions of ncRNAs, but we are still far from understanding what the majority of these RNAs do. In this article, I cover the history, advances, and the outlook for unveiling the functions and properties of these wonder molecules.","date":"2023-09-04","banner":"/static/molecular-processes.jpg","timecode":"00:00:00:89","slug":"rna-tertiary-structure"}],"featured":{"title":"Self-Assembly - What We Can Learn from Biology","abstract":"Proteins spotanesouly assemble into highly-complex shapes with a resolution of a millitonth that of a width of human hair, yet these are some of the most highly conserved and functional molecules that have ever existed. The best human-created technology with equivalent rsolution is about 1000x larger. What can we learn from these robust biological molecules and how can we utilize them for the invention of next-generation nanotechnology?","date":"2022-09-01","banner":"/static/self-assembly.png","featured":true,"timecode":"00:00:00:89","slug":"self-assembling-systems"}},"__N_SSG":true}
